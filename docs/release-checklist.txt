A pseudo-script checklist for Smudge release version x.y.z:
  * Replace upstream and x.y.z in the instructions below
  * For the sake of sanity, make a new sandbox:
        git clone [upstream] smudge-release
  * Bump the version to x.y.z:
        sed -i 's/^\(Version: *\)[0-9.]\+$/\1x.y.z/' smudge.cabal
  * Update the release notes in CHANGES, including closed tickets
    and other interesting changes, paying special attention to
    new features and deprecated or removed features.
  * On both Linux and Windows:
        make release
  * Test against a known set of Smudge files, checking the output.
  * Tag the version:
        git tag x.y.z
  * Push:
        git push
  * Announce, including the release notes.
