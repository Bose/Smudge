Title: Add full unicode support for quoted identifiers.

Right now, the set of valid quoted identifier characters is exclusive rather
than inclusive; as such, valid unicode characters are excluded from the set.

They don't make pretty mangled C identifiers, but unicode characters are
supported as source characters in many targets, including graphviz.

Also, while our parser currently accepts unicode characters in comments, this
is not reflected in our syntax documentation, which reflects the same character
set restriction as quoted identifiers.
