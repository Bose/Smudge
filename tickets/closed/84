Title: extern "C"

The code currently emitted by Smudge can be compiled by a C++ compiler.

However, if we want to be fully C++ friendly, e.g., allow for distributing
precompiled Smudge object files, it would be prudent to drop in the standard
wrappers:

#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif

#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif
