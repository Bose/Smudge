Title: Map.!: given key is not an element in the map

Pull this out into a semantic check, and add a better error message.

In Main.processFile, after passFullyQualify and before
passTagCategories, we can put in a new pass that works the same as the
semantic passes, but is for name checking. It should check for both
state and event name validity (see
counterexamples/badsideeffectname.smudge and
counterexamples/badstatename.smudge).

It would be nice if it could have the same interface as the current
makePasses, but more polymorphic-y.
