Title: Resolve conflict between QualifiedName [] and QualifiedName [""]

Technically these both translate to "" when cooked and served, which is
a possible source of bugs.

After auditing the code, the potential for this bug to occur in smudge
source is non-existent as there is no way to introduce empty names.  Since
resolving the []/Void overlap in the type system changes, this issue can
now only manifest due to errors made actually constructing a QualifiedName
or in calling insertExternalSymbol.  It would be good to knit up those two
leaks anyhow, though.
