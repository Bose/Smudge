Title: Detect undeclared events sent to other state machines.

Right now, this state machine counterexample does not produce any errors, but
it ought to have one, because there is no event named 'q':

WorseSideEffectName
{
    *A
    [
        z -(BadSideEffectName.q)-> A
    ]
}

The reason this does not raise an error is because each state machine's names
are validated one-at-a-time, in isolation.
