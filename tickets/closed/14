Title: Any State + Any Event = Maybe Semantic Pass Failure.

When a state machine has ambiguity between its any-states and
any-events, Smudge should bail out in the semantic pass.

SM
{
    A [ a --, _ -- ],
    B [ b --, _ -- ],
    _ [ a -- ]
}

This makes the B state ambiguous it can't choose whether to use B's
handler for a or the any-state's.

====

The resolution to this was decided to change and enforce precedence
order for events:

state | event
=============
named | named
any   | named
named | any
any   | any

That is, named events take precedence, then named states.

If the priority needs to be modified, this can be accomplished
through the strategic use of submachines, covered in #46
