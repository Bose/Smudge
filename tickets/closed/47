Title: Error granularity finer than SM

Right now, errors are only reported on the SM where they appear.  While useful,
many cases would benefit from state-, event-, or side-effect-level errors
(e.g., two states with the same name, or two functions with conflicting types).

To accomplish this, position annotations must be attached directly to
identifiers rather than only to state machines.
