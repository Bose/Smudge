Title: Friendly message to install GraphViz

Somehow, the user needs to discover that GraphViz is a smudge dependency.
Right now if GraphViz is missing, the error emitted is cryptic:

smudge.exe: dot: runInteractiveProcess: does not exist (No such file or directory)

Besides fixing it in smudge itself, this should probably also be added to the
tutorial.
