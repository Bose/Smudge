Title: C Identifiers can't begin with numbers or underscores

For numbers Smudge should prepend an empty namespace (actually mapped to the
empty string, not _0__), with the corresponding join underscores.  This retains
injectivity because the empty output string is injective as there is no way to
introduce it.

For underscores Smudge should detect that it will emit such an identifier in the
backend, and either emit a warning, or fail with an error.

There should be an escape valve flag that lets the user prefix ALL names (it
must be all, for injectivity reasons) with the SMUDGE namespace.
