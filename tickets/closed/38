Title: Event logging for debugging

It would be nice to have a switch to turn on event logging through
some local print mechanism to make debugging easier. It should also
have a way to turn off the printing for certain events in case they're
spammy.

Likewise, the ability to print something every time we enter a state
would be good. This would go well with 31 in a debugging support
release.

E.g.:

smudge --logevent
smudge --logevent a --logevent "$b"
smudge --logevent --no-logevent a --no-logevent "$b"

smudge --logstate
smudge --logstate A --logstate "$B"
smudge --logstate --no-logstate A --no-logstate "$B"

Without argument, everything is enabled.  A "no-" prefix to the flag causes
logging for those states and events to be disabled.  Later flags supersede
earlier flags.  This would insert calls to "SMUDGE_print".
