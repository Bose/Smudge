Title: States must have at least one event.

Currently, this should be disallowed by the syntax:

$ smudge - <<< "sm { *st [] }"
Wrote file "-.dot"
smudge: Listish values cannot be empty.

It is worth discussing whether this construct has value.

Update:

After discussing, we feel that it does not have value because
"st [ _ -(@panic)- ]" is superior.
