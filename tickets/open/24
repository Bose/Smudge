Title: Handle unresolved symbol bindings.

Some possible solutions:

1. Optionally warn about unresolved symbols, and let the C compiler resolve it.
2. Introduce "import" syntax to smudge, and fail on unresolved symbols.
3. Introduce smudgle-level qualified names, and auto-import.
4. Try to guess where a symbol is located based on the state machine name.
5. Separate compilation and generation; compilation produces an intermediate
   representation on disk, which is used to "link" to generate actual code.
