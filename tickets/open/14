Title: Any State + Any Event = Maybe Semantic Pass Failure.

When a state machine has ambiguity between its any-states and
any-events, Smudge should bail out in the semantic pass.

SM
{
    A [ a --, _ -- ],
    B [ b --, _ -- ],
    _ [ a -- ]
}

This makes the B state ambiguous it can't choose whether to use B's
handler for a or the any-state's.
