Title: Tweak mangling of some internal names.

It is possible to make machines whose state-event handlers alias other
functions.  E.g.,

<<*>>=
basicInterface {
  * Free [ Message -- ],
    Send [ Message -- ],
    Handle [ Message -- ],
    State [ name -- ],
    Event [ name -- ],
    _ [
        initialize --,
        state --,
    ]
}
@

There is no way any of this is desirable since it can't make any sense, and it
can be easily mitigated by modifying the mangling of these symbols.

Furthermore, nasty stuff like this is possible:

<<*>>=
stateNamedEvent {
  * event [ handle -- ],
    _ [ event -- ]
}

explicitEnterExit {
  * st (@f) [
        enter -(@g)-,
        exit -(@h)-> st
    ] (@j)
}
@
