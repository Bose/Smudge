Title: SMs without events

Right now, a state machine like:

<<*>>=
    sm { *A [ _ -- ] }
@

results in the output:

    smudge: Listish values cannot be empty.

This is unfortunate.  It is unlikely that there is a use-case for this syntax.
Either this should be a better error, or a use case for this should be defined.
