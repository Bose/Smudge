Title: Fix output path messiness.

1)
Given a Smudge file that's in ./A/B.smudge

$ smudge --c-h=c.h ./A/B.smudge

will generate "./A/c.h" instead of the expected "./c.h".

2)
$ smudge --c-ext_h=$HOME/c.h ./A/B.smudge

will generate code in ~/c.h that incorrectly includes "B.h" because
B.c and B.h are in the same directory.

3)
$ smudge --outdir=P/Q --c-h=C.h ./A/B.smudge

will generate correct code, despite what's done in case #1 above.
