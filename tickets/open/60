Title: Duration is Complicated.

Events may need to be deallocated by Smudge and not user-written code while
users will need to allocate them.

As a prerequisite to #13, require users to implement free function, and make
use of that inside smudge.

SMUDGE_FreeEvent(void *pointer); <- This is going to have to be
                                    implemented by users. It's for
                                    freeing things like event1 and
                                    event2.

Also: typed functions need to have their events' space allocated.
