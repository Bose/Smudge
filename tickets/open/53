Title: File-level compilation switches

Add an optional line at the beginning of a smudgle, something like this:

#c-no-debug

before the beginning of the Smudge-syntaxed stuff. Use it to override the
command line arguments actually given.

The pound must be in the first column, the flag starting in the second column,
and one switch per line with arguments, but no leading dashes.

They cannot appear after the beginning of a state machine, but can have
interleaved comment and whitespace lines.
