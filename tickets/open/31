Title: Expose a way to get internal state?

A Smudge user wants to expose the state machine's internal state to
TAP for development tests, and the only way to really do that right
now is to add an enter function to every state that duplicates the
state machine's state in the user code.

I propose that we generate a way to get the result of
SM_State_name(SM_state) when --c-no-debug is not turned on. It can
return a string, so we don't have to worry about inconsistent results
on recompiling.
