Title: Inferred Voidness

Some side effect functions (like those called in enter/exit function
context) can't possibly take arguments. The prototypes for these
should incorporate this information, and they should be generated as

void sideEffectFunction(void)

instead of having the event with which they're sometimes associated as
the argument.

This issue touches on a broader problem that currently this:

SM { STATE @foo [ event -(@foo)- ] }

is invalid, since the generated prototype for the first @foo has no
arguments and the prototype for the second has an SM_event_t. Implicit
in the beginning of this ticket is the assumption that we solve this
without calling it invalid Smudge during a semantic pass.
