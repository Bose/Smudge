Title: Generate header file for externally written functions.

Right now, the generated foo.c generates a line to #include
"foo_ext.h". Smudge has all the information needed to generate
foo_ext.h, and should do so when given a command line switch. We
should determine if we want this header to be generated every time or
just once as boiler plate to be edited by the user.
