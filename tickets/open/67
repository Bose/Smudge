Title: Forbid nonsensical any states

M { *A [ x --], _ (@enterAny) [ y -- ] (@exitAny) }

M { *A [ x --], _ --> A }

These two constructions are almost certainly nonsensical, but they are allowed
by the syntax, and generate no useful behavior.

These should be rejected as ill-formed.  As an argument, what would the
semantics even mean?  An any state can't be entered - how could it be
transient?  Do enter/exit events in any states happen before, after, or instead
of enter/exit functions for each state?  Do they only happen when a state
doesn't have enter/exit functions?
