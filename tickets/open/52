Title: Unit tests

In order to support a unit test framework, Smudge should generate a
file with all the stubs (_stubs.c) for the _ext.h file. It should also
generate a _main.c that exercises the state machine.

Outside Smudge, we can use ctypes in Python to hook this in to a test
harness. This isn't strictly Smudge effort, but may get wrapped in
with it.
