Title: GraphViz - concatenate parallel edges.

In a case where there are multiple edges going from one state to another that
run in parallel, e.g.,

sm { *s1 [ e1 --> s2, e2 --> s2], s2[] }

I want to be able to concatenate these edges automatically, and lay them out
with only a single edge, and all the labels.

I have found three ways NOT to do this: the 'Concentrate' attribute, which
doesn't work on labeled edges, making the graph 'strict', which throws away
all but one of the labels, and negating the 'Splines' attribute, which makes
some things angular, and thus overlapping, but overlays edges that point in
opposing directions, and does not seem to operate on edges that go from a
node to itself.

I believe the only way for us to do this is to do it by manually concatenating
labels, making sure that events and side effects are clearly distinguishable.
