Title: PlantUML backend

A Smudge user has requested the feature to output PlantUML, in order
to support directly posting Smudge output to Confluence.

For example, as of today first.smudge would produce something like:

[*] --> FIRST_STATE
FIRST_STATE: Enter:\nenterFirst
FIRST_STATE: Exit:\nexitFirst
FIRST_STATE --> SECOND_STATE : event
FIRST_STATE -[dashed]-> FIRST_STATE : altEvent\nsideEffect
FIRST_STATE --> FIRST_STATE : reenter
SECOND_STATE --> FIRST_STATE : EventAny\nsideEffect
