Title: Unicode names generate non-compliant strings.

smudge --c-stubs - <<<'"Ψζξ" { *"Ψζξ" ["Ψζξ" --]}'

Such a state machine generates strings, e.g.:

    const char *event_name = "\936\950\958";

This is not C89 compliant (because unicode), but nonsense even in C99.

The correct output in C99 for such a case would be:

    const char *event_name = "\u03a8\u03b6\u03be";

For C89, we punt, and leave the user to deal with it.
