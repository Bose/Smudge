Title: Allow known event cycles.

Ticket #21 forbids machines such as this that do not terminate:

sm { *st [ a -( b )-, b -( a )-] }

Because Smudge can determine paths that loop, special syntax could distinguish
between paths that allow loops and paths that don't.  This could either take
the form of a keyword akin to "noreturn" or to a special arrow syntax, e.g.,

sm { *st [ a -( b )->, b -( a )->] }

where there is no destination state, mirroring a return type of bottom.
