Smudge generates recursive calls to SM_enter() in transient states'
enter functions. My platform doesn't support recursion. Right now I'm
working around it in C by manually writing:

static void StateMachine_TRANSIENT_enter(void)
{
    doStuff();

#if 0 /* Replace this (recursive) code */
    StateMachine_change_state(StateMachine_NEXT_STATE_NAME);
#else /* with this (ugly and hard to maintain by hand) code. */
    StateMachine_exit();
    StateMachine_state = StateMachine_NEXT_STATE_NAME;
    StateMachine_NEXT_STATE_NAME_enter();
#endif
}

Ideally, I'd like to wrap this stuff up in an event that's (opaquely)
sent through the system's event deliverer, but I'm not hacking that in
by hand. Minimally, generated code that looks like what I hand wrote
would suffice.
