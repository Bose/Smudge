Title: PackageInfo warning

`make clean && make` includes the following warning, which should be fixed:

dist/build/autogen/PackageInfo.hs:6:131: Warning:
    In the use of ‘versionTags’
    (imported from Distribution.Version, but defined in Data.Version):
    Deprecated: "See GHC ticket #2496"

This appears to require upgrading cabal, which replaces PackageInfo with
Paths_<pkgname>, where this is fixed.  See:
