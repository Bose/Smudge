Title: Event logging for debugging

It would be nice to have a switch to turn on event logging through
some local print mechanism to make debugging easier. It should also
have a way to turn off the printing for certain events in case they're
spammy.

Likewise, the ability to print something every time we enter a state
would be good. This would go well with 31 in a debugging support
release.
