Title: A single state can't handle an event two different ways.

If you redeclare an event handler within a state, Smudge doesn't complain.

Smudge is supposed to produce deterministic state machines, but accepts this
input, which would be nondeterministic (really, it just doesn't compile):

sm { *st [ ev --, ev --> st ] }

Smudge doesn't give an error for this, and it could be caught in a semantic
pass check.
