Title: Reject event cycles.

This program provably doesn't terminate:

sm { *st [ a -( b )-, b -( a )-] }

This should be rejected, because we can.

Also, rejecting that program would reject exit side effects that cause the
state to exit again, in the event that we decide that exit side effects take
place before having exited that state.
