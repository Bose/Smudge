Title: Comment correlation

Figure out a way to propagate comments from smudge code into generated code.

e.g.

Comments before/after the name of a state machine would go at the
beginning of the block that defines the state machine in the generated
output.

Comments with @functions would go in the _ext.h where the @function's
prototype is, or the call site.
