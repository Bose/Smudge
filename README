Smudge is a state machine and uml diagram generation engine.

Smudge is both a language for describing state machines as well as a
compiler that interprets and validates those descriptions to generate
code and documentation for them. Example state machines can be found
in the examples directory. In particular, first.smudge has extensive
comments to describe what it's doing.
